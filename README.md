# Reductions

Reductions is a library for multiple programming languages which provides efficient reductions from various problems to other  problems. For example, reducing a linear programming problem to a max-flow problem is one of the many to-be-implemented reductions available in this library. Each problem instance will also have easy-to-understand interfaces for interacting with that problem for solving and manipulating. Each module may additionally have an efficient solver implemented with it.

The languages to be supported include:

- *Python* - Located within `reductions-py`
- *Java* - Located within `reductions-java`
- *C++* - Located within `reductions-c++`
